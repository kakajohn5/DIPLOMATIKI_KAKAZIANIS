Here is my project called Interactive Process Technologies for People with Autoimmune Bowel Diseases. 
It is currently under construction, so in the file you will find all the files related to the frontend, as well as files that I have started for the backend.
To see the project you can open it in vs code and in the terminal run the npm run dev command. (Ignore the folder DIPLOMATIKI_KAKAZIANIS).
